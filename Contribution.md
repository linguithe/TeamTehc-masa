# Contribution
To contribute to Github, follow these steps. Potential errors will be dealt with later on.
1. Create a new branch and name it as your own name.
2. Publish the branch to Github. If you're using the Github desktop version, the app will notify you to publish your branch to Github.
3. To contribute your code to Github, commit your work to your branch and push to origin. The desktop version will notify you as well. It is better if a checkpoint is reached before committing as it would be easier for potential evaluation.
4. Fetch origin to update any changes on the main branch to your branch.
